Lambent OurReach backend for demo environment.

Cloud9 notes: (to be fixed up some day)

 - When making a new ide, I needed to install php 7.3, the mbscript extension, composer, and httpd. Then I could run composer install to get all the dependencies in order.
   The scripts in /scripts do this as part of the deployment. Those scripts may also work directly in Cloud9.
 - Also need to install and update node and npm.
